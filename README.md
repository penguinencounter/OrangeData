# OrangeData
a compilation of my work

### Contents
* My Orange workflows, in the `myworkflows` directory
* My CSV datasets, in the `sampledata` directory
* My Orange-related Python sricpts, in the `scripts` directory
* A copy of all the lesson data sets, also in `sampledata`

## Orange workflows
The stuff I make in the Orange canvas.

## CSV data: `pets.csv`
1 year's worth of adoptions, drop-offs, and returns to the San Diego Humane Society. **4862** records, last I checked.

## Python scripts
These don't work on their own. They go inside the `Python Script` widget.
